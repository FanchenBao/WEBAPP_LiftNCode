# WEBAPP_learning_notes
A web blog to keep a record of the notes when you learned something new

__(Under development)__
* User registers for the app to post notes about their learning experience of something new. They can create a topic for the new skill they are learning, and add entries (notes) under the specific topic.
* User will be able to view other people's posts with or without log in, but they can only create topic and write entry after registration and log in. Once log in, they can edit their own topic and entries, but they cannot edit other people's topics or entries.
